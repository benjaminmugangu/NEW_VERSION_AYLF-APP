feat(finance): implement SC wallet isolation and territory activity metrics

Resolves friction in the Site Coordinator dashboard by decoupling manageable 
liquidity from direct territory funding injections.

- Logic: Updated budgetService and financialsService to isolate site-level 
wallet funds. Direct allocations to groups no longer inflate the SC's net balance.
- Metrics: Introduced directGroupInjections to provide visibility over funds 
circulating in the territory without impacting the site manager's spending power.
- UI/UX: Enhanced Finance Dashboards with localized StatCards and a 5-column 
grid for sites. Standardized labels (e.g. "Solde Disponible") using i18n keys.
- i18n: Synchronized en.json and fr.json with new keys for financial metrics.
- Docs: Updated User Guide (LaTeX) with a new "Dualité des Flux" section.
- Fixes: Resolved Vercel build errors by fixing missing Wallet icon imports 
and missing useTranslations hook initialization in site finance pages.
- Maintenance: Updated TypeScript interfaces and cleaned up unused imports.
